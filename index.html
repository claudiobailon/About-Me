      <h1>Getting to know Claudio</h1>

      <main>

          <p id="p1"> Hello, <br>
            My name is Claudio Bailon-Schubert, thanks for coming to my webpage!  I grew up in a small farming town in Eastern Washington and graduated from High School in 2007.  I then attended Whitworth University majoring in Math and Computer Science.  I only attended one year and eventually made my way to Washington State University to study Civil Engineering.  That also only lasted a year before I ran out of money and was unsure about my desired career path.</p>

          <p id="p2"> Since then, I've worked a wide variety of jobs.  I spent a lot of time delivering pizza and auto parts, working retail, working at the airport, and, most recently, as a surveyor.  Now I'm taking to dive into software development and hoping to find a way to leave my mark on the word.</p>
